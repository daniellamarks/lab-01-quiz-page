## Making a plan
1) Make a drawing of your app. Simple "wireframes"
2) Once you have a drawing, name the HTML elements you'll need to realize your vision
3) For each HTML element ask: Why do I need this?
    - This is your pseudocode
4) Once we know _why_ we need each element, think about how to implement the "Why" as a "How"
5) Find all the 'events' (user clicks, form submit, etc) in your app. Ask one by one, "What happens when" for each of these events.
6) Think about how to validate each of your steps

Topic of Interest, contents and images

Your web page should contain:

1 Introductory and general content about you or your theme.
2 At least one image
3 At least three sections, each of which is a blurb about you or the topic
4 Include headers as appropriate
5 Use at least one unordered (bullet) list and one ordered (numbered) list
6 A button for the user to take a quiz, and a place to put the quiz result

HTML & CSS
Create an HTML file (index.html)
Create and link a CSS file (main.css)
Add content to your HTML file including all the required sections listed
Add CSS for styling for your page and some layout. See below for styling detail
Commit your work as you go with a message that describes the purpose (why?) of the commit.
Styles
Choose one or two fonts for your page. Often the headers and body content use separate fonts:
https://fonts.google.com/
https://www.fontsquirrel.com/
Choose a color palette/theme for your page:

Design Stretch Goals
Apply additional styling to the page: try things like borders, alignment, margin, padding, and so on.
Search for an online HTML validator and submit your code to it.
Visit this page and read about Chrome's built-in accessibility auditing tools. Following the instructions under the "View the contrast ratio of a text element in the Color Picker" heading, examine the contrast ratio values of your heading and paragraph tags. Modify your code until you can achieve a ratio that gets two check marks.


1. Make html sections. 
    -header
    -three articles
    -section with quiz with button and quiz result

2. TDD countsAsAYes function
    - countsAsAYes 
        -takes in user input
        -returns a boolean based on user input
        -i.e. countsAsAYes('yep') should return "true"
        -i.e. countsAsAYes('nah') should return "false"
