               <h2>Intro</h2>
               <p>
                    There are two components to the nervous system:
                    <ol>
                        <li>The peripheral nervous system</li>
                        <li>The central nervous system</li>
                    </ol>
                    The peripheral nervous system is divided into the somatic nervous system and the autonomic nervous system.

                <h2>The Somatic Nervous System</h2>
                <p> 
                    The somatic nervous system includes the sensory nervous system and the somatosensory system and consists of sensory nerves and somatic nerves, 
                    and many nerves which hold both functions.
                    In the head and neck, cranial nerves carry somatosensory data. 
                    There are twelve cranial nerves, ten of which originate from the brainstem, 
                    and mainly control the functions of the anatomic structures of the head with some exceptions. 
                    One unique cranial nerve is the vagus nerve, which receives sensory information from organs in the thorax 
                    and abdomen. The accessory nerve is responsible for innervating the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles, neither of which being exclusively in the head
                    For the rest of the body, spinal nerves are responsible for somatosensory information.

               <h2>The Autonomic Nervous System</h2>
               <p>
                    The autonomic nervous system (ANS) controls involuntary responses to regulate physiological 
                    functions. The autonomic nervous system is always activated, but is either in the sympathetic 
                    or parasympathetic state. Depending on the situation, one state can overshadow the other, 
                    resulting in a release of different kinds of neurotransmitters. The autonomic nervous system 
                    is comprised of the following:
                     <ul>
                         <li>Sympathetic Nervous System</li>
                         <li>Parasympathetic Nervous System</li>
                         <li>Enteric Nervous System</li>
                     </ul>
               </p>
            </article>
            <article class="article-3">
                <h2>Diseases</h2>
                <p>
                    Diseases of the peripheral nervous system can be specific to one or more nerves, 
                    or affect the system as a whole. Any peripheral nerve or nerve root can be damaged, called a mononeuropathy. 
                    Such injuries can be because of injury or trauma, or compression. 
                    Compression of nerves can occur because of a tumour mass or injury.
